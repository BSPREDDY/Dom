DOM Stands for Document object model

defnition:-
----------
->The DOM (Document Object Model) API is a programming interface for web documents. 
->It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
->The DOM represents the document as a tree of objects; each object represents a part of the page

What was Javascript? 
people wrote js engine on top of the ECMAScript spec.
It was an implementation of the ECMAScript spec

ECMAScript spec --> this is a specification that really smart written a doc they said var is the thing let , const is a thing function is a thing objects are there arrays are there every array should a .length functions so and so fourth.

very smart people implimentation of the spec for example
-->google chrome as actually return the v8 engine
-->which takes some Javascript code converts its into 0's and 1's this of many compilers of the Javascript this is one of many compilers of Javascript 

they return the top of ECMAScript spec 
this is the people how write the actual compiler

                                                converts
ex chrome --> code ---------> Js (V8) engine  -------------> 0's and 1's

chrome as its own compiler
mozilla firefox as its own compiler

What was Javascript? 
But the Javascript that runs in your browser has some extra functionality

ECMAScript DOC:-
--------------
in ECMAScript DOC setTimeOut you will never find out here why because setTimeOut was never part of ECMAScript 
standard the people how wrote Javascript never thought this will be some thing we needed never thought ECMAScript need to support clocks or TimeOut.

What was Javascript? 

we will give some extra functionality top of Javascript this is the Javascript spec that things you will see return here 

                                    browser Js

fetch()-->it was a function to which you if give some inputs this is the end point i have to hit 
-->fetch is a asynchronas call,this code run's in my mechine where is the currect backend running as you saa i open the terminal the bunch of thing here what did it say ubuntu@some ip some server in mumbai  not in the leave current 
simple words-->this request needs go out from my meachine over to a meachine in mumbai and then response need to back.

when we went to loupe website we see a things like a setTimeOut this a part of web API spec and this is some thing browser provide you on top of the original Javascript spec and just like browser provide you some browser specific functionality
all of this setTimeOut, fetch, setInterval, document not part of the Javascript spec it is a small subset this things add on top,browser needs this functionalitys

                                    node Js
                    -----------------------------------------------------------
                    |                                                          |
                    |               setTimeOut                                 |
                    |               http                                       |
                    |               functions                                  |
                    |                                  -------------------     |
                    |                                  | Javascript spec |     |
                    |                                  -------------------     |
                    ------------------------------------------------------------ 

node js provide you backend specific functionality which again not part of the Javascript spec

parseInt()-->it is a global function that converts a string into number
onInput() ---> with out using button add two numbers    
getElementsByClassName()-->it takes class names as input 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Now, lets say you donâ€™t have access to the calculation logic on the frontend 
Lets assume its a hard problem that someone has exposed on a backend server 
And you need to hit the backend server and get back the value
